# Basics of Java in Minecraft
An educational course outlining the basics of Java using the Fabric modding toolchain to mod Minecraft

# Where to Start
I recommend starting with the Master Lesson Plan (in the root directory)
The Master Lesson Plan contains an outline for the entire course structure and what to expect from going through it

# Following the Course
The course is separated into 7 weeks. Each week contains 2 parts: lesson and project
Many parts of the course recommend asking your teacher for advice. In self education, DuckDuckGo is your teacher.
If this proves to not be enough, feel free to add an issue asking for help or submit a pull request explaining something in greater detail.
